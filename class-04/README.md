### issue 1

Bug!
Currently the age and sex filter is not being respected by the cli. Figure out why, then update the code to properly filter letters by those prompts

### issue 2

Feature!
We want to be able to make letters that would go inside the envelopes. Take your previous letter work, and implement another program similar to envelope for letters


Remember between each session of working on the project that you should:
- when stopping work: ctrl c the server, commit and push changes to github
- when starting, run the server, and then in a separate window, test your cli app
