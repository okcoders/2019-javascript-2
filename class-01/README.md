## Class

### Node

- [install](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

### Programs

What is a program?
so far we have written small web pages, and small chunks of code, that often don't amount to much. What do we need to do to get to program status?

- entrypoint (main)
- exit

### Command Line

Why do you need to learn the command line? 
- command line interfaces come first because GUIs are harder to make and take more time
- you can do things faster from the command line once you learn it

#### Commands:

- pwd
- ls
- mkdir
- touch
- mv
- cp
- cat
- | and grep
- command [flags] argument
- redirection (echo "# 2019-javascript-2" >> README.md)

### More Higher Order Functions

- map
- filter
- reduce
